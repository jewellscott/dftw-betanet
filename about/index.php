			<p>If I'm not back in ten minutes, don't send help. It was dead already, sweetheart. Just like the others. There's no such thing as a making-out scholarship. It won't work. My face is too expressive. I could pass the test, but I like having low self-esteem. It makes me feel special. Maybe that one about feeling like a big misfit whom everybody hates. The other kids will really relate to that. I know I do. Well, I have been saving up for a pair of snappy orthopedic shoes.</p>
			<p>Well, my history teacher hates me because I know all the answers, but there are some interesting idiots in my class. Tonight, on Sick, Sad World, a prime-time special about people just like you, only more pathetic. He doesn't know what it means. He's got the speech memorized. Just enjoy the nice man's soothing voice. You know, self-esteem is a little like your car's brake fluid. You may not even know you're low on it until, one day, you go to shift gears and nothing happens. ...That's transmission fluid! You really ought to stick to mineral water and parsley. Sure. And after that, I think I'll swallow glass. Ever thought of becoming a waitress?

			<p>Did she ask you to feed her the chocolate? You sure that's okay with your doctor? The Doo Dad Shop. Oh, good. I've always wanted my own doo dad. Can't talk now. I'm chairing a meeting of the Resting Quietly Club. The mall is a dangerous influence on today's teens and the fluorescent lights give you seizures. Kevin, I already told you, my parents did not conduct experiments on me. Do you think it would dishonor Dr. King's memory if I went to sit in the back of the bus?</p>
			<p>They made me their queen! Isn't it great?! This color looks nothing like melon. It's way too pink. It's the Soul Train. Beep-beep. Get on board. Not much chance of that happening... unless there's uranium in the drinking water here, too. I'm afraid that inflation has forced me to institute a small fee for my services. She's well-liked among classmates of both sexes, and yet, strangely, she turns my stomach. This is like that R.E.M. video, except you can't read anyone's mind.</p>
