I’ve been obsessed with the web since the 00s, back when AIM away messages were an art form. Now I spend my time crafting things in PHP and JavaScript, trying to keep that early-web energy alive in everything I make.</p><h2>About this site</h2><p>This site is a collection of my web projects and the stories behind them. It's a space to share my thought process, technical decisions, and the occasional interesting rabbit hole I fell into while building for the web.</p>"
