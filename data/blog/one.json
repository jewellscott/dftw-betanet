Does that mean these are the best years of our lives? I hope not. What do you plan to do about it? You can't ignore me! I pay your salary. Now, while you're on a roll, am I the sort of man who you suppose believes in underwriting the indolence of students who already display the work habits of garden slugs? The dark side of life. The thoughts other people try not to have. That's your thing, right? Facing the void? Yes, I'm sure you're dealing with it. I'm not dealing with it! Isn't modeling about dropping out of school to pursue a career based solely on your youth and your looks, both of which are inevitably declared over by age twenty-five? This color looks nothing like melon. It's way too pink. So let's just walk in and meet them straight on. They're not going to intimidate us. You sure that's okay with your doctor? I mean, you're not popular, but you're not so unpopular that you couldn't come to my party Saturday night. This is like that R.E.M. video, except you can't read anyone's mind. She's got a dark, threatened look. She never cracked no books. La-la-la... Actually, I'm sending an erotic letter to a female inmate I met on the Internet. I think she's female. I have two econ problem sets and a paper on Kerouac that I have to get to the delivery guy by 9:00 P.M.... and then, I quit. If they start to drive you nuts, tell them you know this great game called \"cemetery.\" They have to lie on the floor and pretend they're dead. The first one to move or make a sound loses. Did someone flash the bimbo signal? Your Mom sounds a little nutty but she's making perfect sense. Does that mean these are the best years of our lives? I hope not. Find some other way to feel. Then you won't feel sad. He can drive, he never has to take a pop quiz, and he can order a mimosa anytime he wants. What's the problem? I knew I should've stayed home. Um, I'm just a freshman and I... we're not really supposed to... I get headaches sometimes 'cause I'm allergic to things. And I... I sort of have to go now, bye. What do you plan to do about it? You can't ignore me! I pay your salary. Are you sleeping in there? You're not a real cop, you know! The Doo Dad Shop. Oh, good. I've always wanted my own doo dad. An encyclopedia is an unusual product for a supermodel to promote, isn't it? You seem awfully young to be doing this kind of work. Daria, would you say sleeping with a guitar in your hands counts as practicing? ...As long as you don't drop it. Now, while you're on a roll, am I the sort of man who you suppose believes in underwriting the indolence of students who already display the work habits of garden slugs? Uh, are we going to need to know this, or is this, like, personal advice or something? She said it was wrong to encourage cheaters and to profit from them. ...So, she's giving up being a lawyer? See? You don't want to do poetry for this crowd. You know how there are people who go to car races on the chance that they might see a crash? You seem pretty comfortable with the brain-dead. So, let's go to a party. I should really make pancakes more often. The batter's so sensual. Friends don't let short-waisted friends wear hip-huggers. Fourteen people pretended not to see me, five crossed the street to get away, seven ran, three called the police, and I'm pretty sure this one guy fired a shot. A weekend on the world's tallest pile of seagull droppings is starting to look pretty good. All right. I had a magnetic device implanted in my head. You always see the downside, don't you? I could pass the test, but I like having low self-esteem. It makes me feel special. Humor may lift your spirits, Daria, but it takes a professional to lift your buttocks! Doctor's joke! Have a nice day girls. And remember, money can make anyone look beautiful. Ah, Quinn, that is excellent. You appear truly to be savoring another's misfortune. Is there another tight pants sale going on at the mall? All right. I had a magnetic device implanted in my head. I know that plenty of guys want to go out with you, and plenty of girls want to go out with me, and that makes me think we should be together. Don't panic. I think we'll be able to lose each other in a crowd of ten thousand. She's God's problem now, kid. I feel bad, but I think I should feel worse, and not feeling worse makes me feel bad all over again. All right, let's not get panicked. We're going to look at the situation calmly and objectively. Agreed? You really ought to stick to mineral water and parsley. She said it was wrong to encourage cheaters and to profit from them. ...So, she's giving up being a lawyer? He can drive, he never has to take a pop quiz, and he can order a mimosa anytime he wants. What's the problem? They made me their queen! Isn't it great?! I don't like to smile unless I have a reason. I hate to tell you this, but there's a big, greasy spot of peanut buttery goodness on your butt. Looks like a sandwich... and it's an antique! Your Mom sounds a little nutty but she's making perfect sense. I find the situation unbelievable myself.

And after that, I think I'll swallow glass. I hope the raging envy you're feeling won't affect our friendship. And don't fashion people squander their lives loudly worshiping all that is superficial and meaningless while the planet keeps riding a roller coaster to hell? A weekend on the world's tallest pile of seagull droppings is starting to look pretty good. As soon as we get there, we find a bar, and we don't leave it until we're unconscious. Don't worry. I don't have low self-esteem. It's a mistake. I have low esteem for everyone else. Maybe I will end up a townie doing Doors covers. I mean, who's to say, right? Did she ask you to feed her the chocolate? Maybe that one about feeling like a big misfit whom everybody hates. The other kids will really relate to that. I know I do. Isn't modeling about dropping out of school to pursue a career based solely on your youth and your looks, both of which are inevitably declared over by age twenty-five?

We're out in the middle of nowhere, nobody knows we're here, we have no way to contact anyone, and our parents have gone insane. I'm going to the picnic, and I'm bringing asbestos insulation, brined shrimp, the cryogenically frozen head of Walt Disney, a dromedary, and... a eurocentric view of world history.
