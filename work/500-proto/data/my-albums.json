They declared him the \u201cteen-age virtuoso\u201d in headlines and described him as the \u201cyoung black wizard from the Twin Cities\u201d in opening paragraphs. Like most praise directed at him over his decades of acclaim, it wasn\u2019t hyperbole: Prince taught himself how to play piano, guitar, drums, and bass by the time he was 14. That unassailable will to realize his divine gifts was in effect before he left high school. Of course, Prince\u2019s genius soon got recognized. Studio owner and producer Chris Moon discovered Prince\u2019s seamless versatility when the future legend was with his high school band Champagne. The two laid down some demos and gave them to ad man-turned-manager Owen Husney, who quickly wanted to know who \u201cthey\u201d were, only to be astounded when Moon told him the act was not a \u201cthey,\u201d but \u201cone 17-year-old kid.\u201d Warner Bros. would end up with the wunderkind, after offering him $180,000 for three albums and creative control. Stage set and bag secured, Prince\u2019s debut album For You dropped on April 7, 1978 with the signature credit: \u201cProduced, arranged, composed, and performed by Prince.\u201d"}]
