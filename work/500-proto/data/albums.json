        "description": "Loss, love, forced coming-of-age, and fragile generational hope: Arcade Fire\u2019s debut touched on all these themes as it defined the independent rock of the \u201800s. Built on family ties (leader Win Butler, his wife, R\u00e9gine Chassagne, his brother Will), the Montreal band made symphonic rock that truly rocked, simultaneously outsize and deeply personal, like the best pop. But for all its sad realism, Butler&#8217;s is music that still finds solace, and purpose, in communal celebration.",

But after spending 16 months in the studio working on Ask Rufus, they came out with a record that gave their songs more room to breathe, anticipating the lithe, loose arrangements of Nineties neo-soul. Khan glided through the head-nodding &#8220;Everlasting Love&#8221; and the twisty-turny &#8220;Better Days,&#8221; and fans appreciated the adjustment: Ask Rufus was the group&#8217;s first platinum record.",

Rosal\u00eda assumes a rapper&#8217;s bravado in the opening track, &#8220;Malamente,&#8221; and in the palma-pop gem &#8220;Di Mi Nombre,&#8221; she grabs her bullish lover by the horns. The result is one of the best ancient-modern mash-ups of the 21st century.",

She had her first Number One album, Cheap Thrills, as lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company, and made an uneven solo debut. Pearl was more intimate, more assured, unleashing her Texas-bred wail on the country-style soul tune \u201cGet It While You Can\u201d and the Number One hit \u201cMe and Bobby McGee.\u201d Sadly, Joplin didn\u2019t live to enjoy her fame. She died of a drug overdose in 1970, before the album was completed.",

The Pretenders\u2019 debut is filled with no-nonsense New Wave rock such as \u201cMystery Achievement\u201d \u2014 plus a cover of \u201cStop Your Sobbing,\u201d by the Kinks\u2019 Ray Davies (three years later, the father of Hynde\u2019s child). The biggest hit was \u201cBrass in Pocket,\u201d a song of ambition and seduction. Hynde, however, wasn\u2019t so sure about the song\u2019s success. \u201cI was embarrassed by it,\u201d she said. \u201cI hated it so much that if I was in Woolworth\u2019s and they started playing it, I\u2019d have to run out of the store.\u201d",

The album sold 25 million copies worldwide, and four singles went to Number One in the U.S. \u201cYou either see pop music as a contemporary art form, or you don\u2019t.

But it&#8217;s singer Beth Gibbon\u2019s brooding, pop-cabaret vocals that make it feel classic, hinting at real pain below trip-hop\u2019s stoned exterior.

We would go in and stay for two or three days at a time.\u201d With guitarist Joe Walsh replacing Bernie Leadon, the band backed off from straight country rock in favor of the harder sound of \u201cLife in the Fast Lane.\u201d The highlight is the title track, a monument to the rock-aristocrat decadence of the day and a feast of triple-guitar interplay. \u201cEvery band has their peak,\u201d Henley said. \u201cThat was ours.\u201d",

Yet the template for everything Zeppelin achieved in the 1970s is here: brutal rock (\u201cCommunication Breakdown\u201d), thundering power balladry (\u201cYour Time Is Gonna Come\u201d), and acid-flavored folk blues (\u201cBabe I\u2019m Gonna Leave You\u201d).",

While he recuperated, the Band backed him on the demos later known as The Basement Tapes and made their own debut. Dylan offered to play on the album; the Band said no thanks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just ride his shirttail,\u201d drummer Levon Helm said. Dylan contributed \u201cI Shall Be Released\u201d and co-wrote two other tunes.

Williams, who was born in Louisiana, describes the South in a loving, fearful tone (\u201cBroken down shacks, engine parts\u201d in one song, \u201cBusted-down doors and borrowed cash\u201d in another) and mourns pals who fell prey to hard liquor, drugs, or dreams of stardom.

After two days of mourning, guitarist Malcolm Young thought, \u201cWell, fuck this, I\u2019m not gonna sit around mopin\u2019 all fuckin\u2019 year.\u201d He called his brother, guitarist Angus Young, and they went back to work with replacement vocalist Brian Johnson. The resulting album has the relentless logic of a sledgehammer. Back in Black remains the purest distillation of hard rock: \u201cHells Bells,\u201d \u201cYou Shook Me All Night Long,\u201d and the title track have all become enduring anthems of strutting blues-based guitar.",

She was so intimidated by the idea of recording with session guys from her favorite Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding hits that she never actually managed to sing a note there. Her vocals were overdubbed later, when the sessions moved to New York.

Her breakthrough second album (recorded in Brooklyn with co-producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi) marked the arrival of a resplendently damaged 21st-century torch singer. Tracks like the mildly pushy \u201cYou Know I\u2019m No Good\u201d and the sumptuous \u201cLove Is a Loving Game\u201d had an elegant, beguiling smudginess that avoided the wax-museum quality of so much retro soul. \u201cMy odds are stacked,\u201d Winehouse sings. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to black.\u201d Indeed, the pain and tumult in her voice was very real.

Davis and his peerless band \u2014 bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley \u2014 soloed in uncluttered settings, typi\ufb01ed by \u201cmelodic rather than harmonic variation,\u201d as Davis put it. Two numbers, \u201cAll Blues\u201d and \u201cFreddie Freeloader\u201d (the latter featuring Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), are in 12-bar form, but Davis\u2019 approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom.",

It is a record of fearless breadth and lyrical depth. Singer-songwriter Lou Reed documented carnal desire and drug addiction with a pop wisdom he learned as a song-factory composer for Pickwick Records. Cale introduced the power of pulse and drone (from his work in early minimalism); guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played with tribal force; Nico, a German vocalist brie\ufb02y added to the band by manager Andy Warhol, brought an icy femininity to the heated ennui in Reed\u2019s songs.

Ready to Die executive producer Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs, who\u2019d read about the fledgling Brooklyn rapper in The Source magazine, pushed his new discovery to leaven the stick-up-kid self-mythologizing of \u201cMachine Gun Funk\u201d and \u201cGimme the Loot\u201d with inviting party-up pop like \u201cBig Poppa\u201d and the ecstatically playful origin story \u201cJuicy.\u201dBut it was Biggie\u2019s gift of gab, enormous personality, and sense of humor that made Ready to Die so wonderful \u2014 whether he was offering a 360-degree vision of the mean streets of Fort Greene on \u201cThings Done Changed,\u201d kicking it Bonnie and Clyde-style on \u201cMe and My Bitch,\u201d or delivering rags-to-riches brags like \u201cBirthdays was the worst days/Now we sip champagne when we\u2019re thirsty.\u201d In the process, he changed rap forever. He ends the album with the dark prophecy of &#8220;Suicidal Thoughts.&#8221; As with Kurt Cobain, his tragic death while still in his twenties will always leave us wondering how far he might have gone.",

        "description": "Bruce Springsteen spent everything he had \u2014 patience, energy, studio time, the physical endurance of his E Street Band \u2014 to ensure that his third album was a masterpiece. His reputation as a perfectionist begins here: There are a dozen guitar overdubs on the title track alone. He was also spending money he didn\u2019t have. Engineer Jimmy Iovine had to hide the mounting recording bills from the Columbia paymasters. \u201cThe album became a monster,\u201d Springsteen told his biographer, Dave Marsh. \u201cIt just ate up everyone\u2019s life.\u201dBut in making Born to Run, Springsteen was living out the central drama in the album\u2019s tenement-love operas (\u201cBackstreets,\u201d \u201cJungleland\u201d) and gun-the-engine rock &amp; roll (\u201cThunder Road,\u201d \u201cBorn to Run\u201d): the fight to reconcile big dreams with crushing reality. He found it so hard to translate the sound in his head \u2014 the Jersey-bar dynamite of his live gigs, Phil Spector\u2019s Wagnerian grandeur, the heartbreaking melodrama of Roy Orbison\u2019s hits \u2014 that Springsteen nearly scrapped Born to Run for a straight-up concert album. But his make-or-break attention to detail \u2014 including the iconic cover photo of Springsteen leaning onto saxman Clarence Clemons, a perfect metaphor for Springsteen\u2019s brotherly reliance on the E Street Band \u2014 assured the integrity of Born to Run\u2019s success. In his determination to make a great album, Springsteen produced a timeless, inspiring record about the labors and glories of aspiring to greatness.",

The band had the freedom to do whatever it wanted after its 1997 alt-rock breakthrough, OK Computer [see No. 42]. \u201cEveryone expected us to become this U2 type of band, with that stadium credibility,\u201d bassist Colin Greenwood said in 2001.Instead, frontman Thom Yorke gorged on albums by avant-techno innovator Aphex Twin and other artists on the Warp Records roster, inspiring him to put down his guitar and embrace the glacial beauty of abstract electronics, glitchy beats, and the challenge of free-form composition. \u201cIt was difficult for the others [in the band], \u2019cause when you\u2019re working with a synthesizer it\u2019s like there\u2019s no connection,\u201d Yorke said in 2017. What emerged was at once scary and enveloping, pitched between deep alienation and profound tenderness \u2014 from the womblike ambient flow of \u201cEverything in Its Right Place\u201d to the free-jazz implosion \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d to the gizmo-groove paranoia of \u201cIdioteque.\u201d\u201cI find it difficult to think of the path we\u2019ve chosen as \u2018rock music,\u2019 \u201d Yorke told Rolling Stone in 2000. \u201cKid A is like getting a massive eraser out and starting again.\u201d",

My passion is bringing storylines around and constructing a full body of work, rather than just a 16-bar verse.\u201d\u201cAlright\u201d became a Black Lives Matter anthem, with \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d as the flip side. \u201cHow Much a Dollar Cost\u201d is a haunting meditation on mortality, set to a Radiohead piano loop.

But that was literally only the beginning.The rest of the album, recorded in a shocking six days, was just as revelatory. If anyone questioned whether or not Dylan had truly \u201cgone electric,\u201d the roaring rock &amp; roll of \u201cFrom a Buick 6\u201d and \u201cTombstone Blues\u201d \u2014 both powered by legendary guitarist Mike Bloom\ufb01eld of the Paul Butter\ufb01eld Blues Band \u2014 left no doubt. The album ends with \u201cDesolation Row,\u201d a swirling 11-minute surrealist night journey of indescribable power, a Hieronymus Bosch-like season in hell that, in retrospect, seems to foretell all the Sixties cataclysms to come. Not that Dylan wasn\u2019t having fun all the while as well. The toy siren that opens the album\u2019s title track was keyboardist\u2019s Al Kooper\u2019s playful way of policing the recording sessions for Highway 61 Revisited. \u201cIf anybody started using drugs anywhere,\u201d he explained, \u201cI\u2019d walk into the opposite corner of the room and just go whooooooooo.\u201d",

        "description": "Our relationship with Kanye West was still in its love-hate phase when he created the 21st century\u2019s most awe-inspiring hip-hop masterpiece. It\u2019s an album every bit as chaotic as he was at the time \u2014 from the creepy funk of \u201cGorgeous\u201d to the crushing attack of \u201cHell of a Life.\u201d After his Taylor Swift VMAs fiasco in 2009, West went into a kind of self-exile, eventually ending up in Hawaii, where he imported a huge group of collaborators who included Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, Nicki Minaj, and RZA.In all-night recording sessions, he\u2019d ping between studios, sculpting his most maximalist music ever; \u201ca song like \u2018Power\u2019 took 5,000 hours,\u201d he later said, \u201clike literally.\u201d West pulled from everywhere \u2014 Elton John played on \u201cAll of the Lights,\u201d and \u201cPower\u201d sampled prog-rockers King Crimson. West&#8217;s sense of his own grandiose ambitions bordered on the comical; during the writing process for the nine-minute &#8220;Runaway,&#8221; he famously told guest rapper Pusha T to add &#8220;more douchebag&#8221; to his verses. The resulting track opened with just a single, eerie piano note before building into a mountainous, anarchic tune that incorporated everything from a Rick James sample to a vocoder that evoked Robert Fripp&#8217;s guitar playing on Brian Eno albums.The sonic overkill was lavish, but the record hit so hard because he mixed megalomania with introspect; \u201cYou been puttin\u2019 up wit\u2019 my shit just way too long,\u201d he rapped on \u201cRunaway.\u201d West later called Dark Fantasy an apology record.\u201d Perhaps.

Produced with no-surrender energy by legendary Sixties studio madman Guy Stevens, the Clash\u2019s third album sounds like a free-form radio broadcast from the end of the world, skidding from bleak punk (\u201cLondon Calling\u201d) to rampaging ska (\u201cWrong \u2019Em Boyo\u201d) and disco resignation (\u201cLost in the Supermarket\u201d).The album was made in dire straits too. Although the Clash \ufb01red singles into the Britain\u2019s Top 40 with machine-gun regularity, the band was heavily in debt and openly at war with its record company. Singer-guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, the Clash\u2019s Lennon and McCartney, wrote together in Jones\u2019 grandmother\u2019s \ufb02at, where he was living for lack of dough. \u201cJoe, once he learned how to type, would bang the lyrics out at a high rate of good stuff,\u201d Jones noted. \u201cThen I\u2019d be able to bang out some music while he was hitting the typewriter.\u201d Stevens was on hand for inspiration. He threw chairs around the room \u201cif he thought a track needed zapping up,\u201d according to Strummer. The album ends with \u201cTrain in Vain,\u201d a rousing song of \ufb01delity (originally unlisted on the back cover) that became the sound of triumph: the Clash\u2019s \ufb01rst Top 30 single in the U.S.",

Still in his early twenties, the R&amp;B child star of the 1970s had ripened into a Technicolor soul man: a singer, dancer, and songwriter with incomparable crossover instincts.  He and producer Quincy Jones established the something-for-everyone template of Thriller on 1979\u2019s Off the Wall [see No. 36], on which Jackson captures the rare mania of his life \u2014 the applause and paranoia, the need for love and the fear of commitment \u2014 in a crisp fusion of pop hooks and dance beats. On Thriller, the pair heighten the sheen (the jaunty gloss of \u201cThe Girl Is Mine,\u201d with a guest vocal by Paul McCartney), pump upthe theater (the horror-movie spectacular \u201cThriller\u201d), and deepen the funk. With its locomotive cadence and an acrobatic metal-guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen, \u201cBeat It\u201d was arguably the first industrial-disco Number One.  It is hard now to separate Thriller from its commercial stature (Number One for 37 weeks, 33 million copies sold), the nightmarish tabloid celebrity that led to Jackson\u2019s death, and the horrific revelations about him that have surfaced in recent years.

It speaks volumes that the first song the band worked on upon entering Abbey Road studios in April 1966 would have been impossible to replicate live \u2014 a swirl of hazy guitar, backward tape loops, kaleidoscopic drum tumble, and John Lennon\u2019s voice recorded to sound like \u201cthe Dalai Lama singing from the highest mountaintop.\u201d They titled it \u201cThe Void\u201d and later renamed it \u201cTomorrow Never Knows.\u201d \u201cI was wondering how George Martin would take it,\u201d Paul McCartney later recalled. Martin\u2019s response: \u201cJolly interesting.\u201dThe Beatles\u2019 lives were changing too: Lennon had taken LSD at this point, George Harrison was deepening his interest in Eastern mysticism, and McCartney was getting into avant-garde composition. All those influences came through here.Revolver wasn\u2019t totally without precedent. The Beatles&#8217; previous album, Rubber Soul [see No. 35], had a similar experimental introspect. Harrison once said Rubber Soul and Revolver \u201ccould be volume one and volume two.\u201d But no band, including the Beatles, had tried anything like McCartney\u2019s strikingly mature art song \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d Lennon\u2019s trippy tape-loop swirl \u201cI\u2019m Only Sleeping,\u201d or Harrison\u2019s \u201cTaxman,\u201d with its cutting groove and lyrics that took shots at British politicians.It made sense that the disappointing live shows the band played in the summer of 1966 would be their last. By the time Revolver came out, they\u2019d already entered another world.",

        "description": "\u201cThis is a very sexist industry,\u201d Lauryn Hill told Essence magazine in 1998. \u201cThey\u2019ll never throw the \u2018genius\u2019 title to a sister.\u201d Though already a star as co-leader of the Fugees, with Wyclef Jean, she was hungry to express her own vision. \u201c[I wanted to] write songs that lyrically move me and have the integrity of reggae and the knock of hip-hop and the instrumentation of classic soul,\u201d the singer said of her debut album.She took control of the recording process, writing, producing, arranging, and helming sessions that included collaborators like pianist John Legend, still in college when he got the call to go out to New Jersey, where Hill was recording, and the pathfinding R&amp;B artist D\u2019Angelo. They shaped a sound that went from the money-hating banger \u201cLost Ones\u201d to subtle, glorious, heartbreaking monuments such as \u201cEx-Factor\u201d (reportedly about Wyclef Jean) and the swinging sermon \u201cDoo Wop (That Thing).\u201d For \u201cI Used to Love Him,\u201d Hill duetted with her hip-hop-soul forebear Mary J. Blige. Each song was driven by a clarity of vision and personal honesty that felt revelatory; in \u201cTo Zion,\u201d she detailed her struggles as an ambitious professional and a new mom. Miseducation\u2019s musical legacy is just as deep; at a time when pop was becoming increasingly slick and digitized in the go-go Nineties, here was an album that showed the commercial appeal of a rawer sound; \u201cI wanna hear that thickness of sound,\u201d Hill said. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that from a computer, because a computer\u2019s too perfect. But that human element, that\u2019s what makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I love that.\u201d",

        "description": "Bob Dylan once introduced this album\u2019s opening song, \u201cTangled Up in Blue,\u201d onstage as taking him 10 years to live and two years to write. It was, for him, a pointed reference to the personal crisis \u2014 the collapse of his marriage to Sara Lowndes \u2014 that at least partly inspired this album, Dylan\u2019s best of the 1970s. In fact, he wrote all of these lyrically piercing, gingerly majestic folk-pop songs in two months, in mid-1974. He was so proud of them that he privately auditioned almost all of the album, from start to \ufb01nish, for pals and peers, including Mike Bloom\ufb01eld, David Crosby, and Graham Nash, before cutting them in September \u2014 in just a week, with members of the bluegrass band Deliverance.But in December, Dylan played the record for his brother, David, in Minneapolis, who suggested recutting some songs with local musicians. The \ufb01nal Blood was a mix of New York and Minneapolis tapes; the New York versions are slower, more pensive, while the Minneapolis versions are faster and wilder. Together, they frame the gritty anguish in Dylan\u2019s vocals, as he rages through some of his most passionate, confessional songs \u2014 from adult breakup ballads like \u201cYou\u2019re a Big Girl Now\u201d and \u201cIf You See Her, Say Hello\u201d to the sharp-tongued opprobrium of \u201cIdiot Wind,\u201d his greatest put-down song since \u201cLike a Rolling Stone.\u201d\u201cA lot of people tell me they enjoyed that album,\u201d Dylan said soon after it became an instant commercial and critical success. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to relate to that \u2014 I mean, people enjoying that type of pain.\u201d Yet Dylan had never turned so much pain into so much musical splendor.",

        "description": "\u201cI think Purple Rain is the most avant-garde, \u2018purple\u2019 thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Prince told Ebony in 1986. He was still a rising star with only a couple of hits when he got the audacious idea to make a movie based on his life, and make his next LP the movie\u2019s soundtrack. When it was released in 1984, he became the first artist to have the Number One song, album, and movie in North America. But Purple Rain was so much more than a huge movie soundtrack: It was a testament to Prince\u2019s dream of creating a utopian Top 40, a place where funk, psychedelia, heavy-metal shredding, huge ballads, and daring experimentalism could coexist. \u201cListening to Purple Rain now, it\u2019s kind of like a Beatles album,\u201d keyboardist Matt Fink of the Revolution told Rolling Stone shortly after Prince\u2019s death in 2016. \u201cEvery song is just so brilliant in its own way \u2014 all so unique and different.\u201dIt\u2019s an incredible balance of contradicting impulses \u2014 from the pornographic \u201cDarling Nikki\u201d to the sparkling innocence of \u201cTake Me With You.\u201d When Purple Rain director Albert Magnoli asked for a good song to back a montage sequence, Prince came in the next day with \u201cWhen Doves Cry,\u201d a stark, eccentric-sounding brokenhearted song that became his first Number One single.The title track was one of several songs recorded live at his hometown club, First Avenue, in Minneapolis (strings and overdubs were added later in the studio). It was inspired by Bob Seger, of all people \u2014 when Prince was touring behind 1999 [see No. 130] in 1983, Seger was playing many of the same markets. Prince didn\u2019t understand the Midwestern rocker\u2019s appeal, but decided to try a ballad in the Seger mode \u2014 the result may be the greatest rock ballad of all time.",

As John later told Rolling Stone of the atmosphere during the making of Rumours, \u201cParties going on all over the house. Amazing. Terrifying. Huge amounts of illicit materials, yards and yards of this wretched stuff. Days and nights would just go on and on.\u201dThis frenzied, decadent vibe lent a highly charged, confessional aura to such songs as Buckingham\u2019s \u201cGo Your Own Way,\u201d Nicks\u2019 \u201cDreams,\u201d Christine\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop,\u201d and the group-composed anthem to betrayal, \u201cThe Chain.\u201d The band\u2019s soap opera fueled its own intricate creative conversation; on \u201cYou Make Loving Fun,\u201d Christine sang about her new boyfriend, the band\u2019s lighting designer, as her ex John dutifully drives home the song with a sunny, funky bass line. To write \u201cDreams,\u201d Nicks sat on a black velvet bed in a tiny room hidden deep in the Record Plant, where the band was recording, creating one of her most haunting songs in 10 minutes. \u201c[In \u2018Go Your Own Way\u2019] Lindsey is saying go ahead and date other men and go live your crappy life, and [I\u2019m] singing about the rain washing you clean,&#8221; Nicks said. &#8220;We were coming at it from opposite angles, but we were really saying the same exact thing.\u201d The Mac\u2019s catchy expos\u00e9s, produced with California-sunshine polish, touched a nerve: Rumours became the sixth-best-selling album of all time.",

Few albums have had such an overpowering impact on a generation \u2014 a nation of teens suddenly turned punk \u2014 and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of success led already-troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain to take his own life in 1994.But his slashing riffs, corrosive singing, and deviously oblique writing \u2014 rammed home by the Zeppelin-via-Pixies might of bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl \u2014 put warrior purity back in rock &amp; roll. Lyrically, Cobain raged in code \u2014 shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing. His genius, though, in songs like \u201cLithium,\u201d \u201cBreed,\u201d and \u201cTeen Spirit\u201d was the soft-loud tension he created between verse and chorus, restraint and assault. Cobain was a pop lover at heart \u2014 and a Beatlemaniac: Nevermind co-producer Butch Vig remembered hearing Cobain play John Lennon\u2019s \u201cJulia\u201d at sessions. Cobain also fought to maintain his underground honor with songs like the scabrous punk purge \u201cTerritorial Pissings.\u201d Ultimately, it was a losing battle, but it is part of this album\u2019s enduring power. Vig recalled when Cobain was forced to overdub the guitar intro to \u201cTeen Spirit\u201d because he couldn\u2019t nail it live with the band: \u201cThat pissed him off. He wanted to play [the song] live all the way through.\u201d",

That January, the Beatles were on the verge of a breakup, exhausted and angry with one another after the disastrous sessions for the aborted Get Back LP, later salvaged as Let It Be [see No. 342]. Yet determined to go out with the same glory with which they had \ufb01rst entranced the world at the start of the decade, the group reconvened at EMI\u2019s Abbey Road Studios to make their most polished album: a collection of superb songs cut with an attention to re\ufb01ned detail, then segued together (especially on Side Two) with conceptual force.There was no thematic link, other than the Beatles\u2019 unique genius. John Lennon veered from the stormy metal of \u201cI Want You (She\u2019s So Heavy)\u201d to the exquisite vocal sunrise of \u201cBecause.\u201d Paul McCartney was saucy (\u201cOh! Darling\u201d), silly (\u201cMaxwell\u2019s Silver Hammer\u201d), and deliciously bitter (\u201cYou Never Give Me Your Money\u201d). George Harrison proved his long-secret worth as a composer with \u201cSomething\u201d (later covered by Frank Sinatra) and the folk-pop diamond \u201cHere Comes the Sun,\u201d written in his friend Eric Clapton\u2019s garden after a grim round of business meetings. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison reputedly sang more three-part harmonies here than on any other Beatles album. That warm feeling \u2014 a sense of an increasingly divided band warmly coming together as friends \u2014 may be one reason Abbey Road has become the most beloved Beatles album of all time.",

More, in fact, than he could fit onto a double album \u2013 also included was a bonus EP, a seven-inch single with four more songs from the sessions.Songs, released in 1976, encompasses an incredible range of life experiences \u2013 from the giddy joy of a baby in the bathtub (\u201cIsn\u2019t She Lovely,\u201d featuring the cries and giggles of Wonder\u2019s infant daughter Aisha Morris) through tributes to his musical heroes (\u201cSir Duke\u201d) to dismay about the indifference of the wealthy (\u201cVillage Ghetto Land\u201d). Wonder pulled from every imaginable musical source \u2014 the ecstatic \u201cSir Duke\u201d references Duke Elington and Ella Fitzgerald, while \u201cAs\u201d featured Herbie Hancock on Fender Rhodes. Though Wonder\u2019s blindness meant he could record faster by memorizing lyrics, some songs had four or five intricate verses, so somebody had to prompt him. Often it was engineer John Fischbach, reading lines into the headphone mix just seconds before Wonder sang them. \u201cHe never got thrown off,\u201d engineer John Fischbach told Rolling Stone years later. \u201cHis vocals had so much power.\u201dThe album\u2019s mastery of many styles remains astonishing, but the feat might not have meant so much had Wonder not delivered some of his most impassioned political art as well, like the autobiographical \u201cI Wish,\u201d the takedown of wealthy complacency \u201cVillage Ghetto Land,\u201d and, perhaps most movingly, \u201cBlack Man,\u201d in which he runs down a funky list of global Afro-diasporic aspirations and heroes. Songs in the Key of Life linked all this together, in Wonder&#8217;s all-encompassing innervision.",

Let\u2019s see if they can take it. Let\u2019s get real.\u2019 So I wrote Blue.\u201dFrom its smoky, introspective cover to its wholly unguarded approach to songwriting, Blue is the first time any major rock or pop artist had opened up so fully, producing what might be the ultimate breakup album and setting a still-unmatched standard for confessional poetry in pop music. Using acoustic instruments and her octave-leaping voice, Mitchell portrayed herself as a lonely painter, aching to make sense of all her heartbreak. She reflects on past relationships and encounters, including a chef from Crete (\u201cCarey\u201d) and rock luminaries like Graham Nash (\u201cMy Old Man\u201d), Leonard Cohen (\u201cA Case of You\u201d), and James Taylor (\u201cThis Flight Tonight\u201d), who lent a hand on a few tracks. Along with its romantic melancholy, Blue was the sound of a woman availing herself of the romantic and sexual freedom that was, until then, an exclusively male province in rock.The songs had such stark, emotional intensity that it shocked the men around her: \u201cKris Kristofferson said to me, \u2018Oh, Joni. Save something for yourself.&#8217; The vulnerability freaked them out.\u201d On \u201cLittle Green,\u201d she opens up about a baby she had given up for adoption, and on the staggering piano dirge \u201cRiver,\u201d she takes responsibility for a romance gone wrong, changing the scope of love songs forever: \u201cI\u2019m so hard to handle/I\u2019m selfish, and I\u2019m sad,\u201d she laments. \u201cNow I\u2019ve gone and lost the best baby/That I ever had.\u201dMitchell continued to release excellent records throughout the Seventies, but Blue remains her masterpiece. \u201cThe Blue album, there\u2019s hardly a dishonest note in the vocals,\u201d she told Rolling Stone in 1979. \u201cAt that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world, and I couldn\u2019t pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defenses there either.\u201d",

The Beatles made a point of echoing them on Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band \u2013 an acknowledgment that Pet Sounds was the inspiration for the Beatles\u2019 masterpiece. That gesture actually completed a circle of in\ufb02uence: Wilson initially conceived of Pet Sounds as an effort to top the Beatles\u2019 Rubber Soul. With its vivid orchestration, lyrical ambition, elegant pacing, and thematic coherence, Pet Sounds invented \u2014 and in several senses, perfected \u2014 the notion that an album could be more than the sum of its parts. When Wilson sang, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we were older,\u201d on the album\u2019s magnificent opening song, he wasn\u2019t just imagining a love that could evolve past high school, he was suggesting a new grown-up identity for rock &amp; roll music itself.Wilson made Pet Sounds without the rest of the band, using them only to \ufb02esh out the vocal arrangements. He even considered putting the album out as a solo project, and the \ufb01rst single, \u201cCaroline, No,\u201d was released under his own name. The personal nature of the songs, which Wilson co-wrote primarily with lyricist Tony Asher, further distinguished the album from the Beach Boys\u2019 previous hits. Its luxurious sound conveys a heartbreaking wistfulness, as songs such as \u201cI Just Wasn\u2019t Made for These Times\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Waiting for the Day\u201d bid farewell to the innocent world of the early Sixties.The album\u2019s centerpiece is \u201cGod Only Knows,\u201d arranged with harpsichord, horns, sleigh bells, and strings to create a spiritual feeling Wilson later compared to \u201cbeing blind, but in being blind, you can see more. You close your eyes; you\u2019re able to see a place or something that\u2019s happening.\u201d In the years to come, countless artists would live in his vision.",

        "description": "Marvin Gaye&#8217;s masterpiece began as a reaction to police brutality. In May 1969, Renaldo \u201cObie\u201d Benson, the Four Tops\u2019 bass singer, watched TV coverage of hundreds of club-wielding cops breaking up the People\u2019s Park, a protest hub in Berkeley. Aghast at the violence, Benson began to write a song with Motown lyricist Al Cleveland, trying to capture the confusion and pain of the times. He knew he had something big in his nascent version of \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d but the rest of the Four Tops weren\u2019t interested, and Benson\u2019s efforts to get Joan Baez to record it didn\u2019t work out, either.But one of Motown\u2019s biggest stars and greatest voices turned out to be more receptive. Gaye was in a dark and contemplative place, wounded by the death of his frequent duet partner Tammi Terrell, yearning to sing subtler and more substantive material, and mulling over his brother Frankie\u2019s horrifying tales of his recent stint fighting in Vietnam. Gaye had been keeping busy writing for and producing a group called the Originals, and trying to figure out what was next. \u201cI\u2019d been stumbling around for an idea,\u201d he told biographer David Ritz. \u201cI knew there was more inside me. And that was something no record executive or producer could see. But I saw it. I knew I had to get out there.\u201dAfter some hesitation, Gaye embraced \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d and with the help of arranger David Van De Pitte, crafted a version of the song that was jazzier and more sophisticated than any Motown recording to date, layering cinematic strings over James Jamerson\u2019s supernaturally sinuous bass line and a polyrhythmic groove. Gaye unleashed one of his most spectacular vocal performances in a career full of them, scatting and improvising around the main melody.Motown Records founder Berry Gordy initially resisted releasing \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On,\u201d telling Gaye that he thought scatting was out of date and protest lyrics were too commercially risky. But when the song became an instant hit, Gordy gave Gaye a single month to craft an album to accompany \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On.\u201d Gaye more than rose to the challenge. \u201cI work best under pressure and when I\u2019m depressed,\u201d he told the Detroit Free Press at the time. \u201cThe world\u2019s never been as depressing as it is right now. We\u2019re killing the planet, killing our young men in the streets, and going to war around the world. Human rights \u2026 that\u2019s the theme.\u201dWhat emerged was soul music\u2019s first concept album, and one of the most important and influential LPs ever made. John Legend recently described it as \u201cthe voice of black America speaking out that we couldn\u2019t always smile on cue for you.\u201d Building it all around one finished song lent What\u2019s Going On a musical and thematic through line. \u201cWhat\u2019s Happening Brother\u201d assumes the voice of a Vietnam vet like Gaye\u2019s brother, puzzled by a changing America and looking for work; \u201cMercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\u201d is a taut ode to the environment; \u201cFlyin\u2019 High (In the Friendly Sky)\u201d takes on drug addiction.After What\u2019s Going On, black musicians at Motown and elsewhere felt a new freedom to push the musical and political boundaries of their art. \u201cWhen I was struggling for the right of the Motown artist to express himself,\u201d Gaye said, \u201cStevie [Wonder] knew I was also struggling for him.\u201dAt the end of the final song on What\u2019s Going On, the lament \u201cInner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\u201d the music shifts back into a jazzier reprise of the title track. As the album fades out, the groove continues on. Five decades later, it still hasn\u2019t stopped.",
