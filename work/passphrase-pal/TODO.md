		[ ] Take phrase
		[ ] Randomly convert characters to numbers
		[ ] Insert special characters
		[ ] Check for length
		[ ] Add more numbers if needed
[ ] Clean it up
	[ ] UI
		[ ] Components
		[ ] Stylesheets
[ ] Case Study



[ ] Stages (in loose order - still figuring things out)
	[ ] Code
		[ ] Just JS
		[ ] Use classes
		[ ] Add a handler
		[ ] Allow users to lock/randomize phrase parts (tied to UI)
		[ ] Allow custom passphrases
		[ ] Split into modules (maybe? ex. just helper functions, event handlers)
		[ ] Testing?
		[ ] Split phrases parts into categories and let users choose
		[ ] LocalStorage 
	[ ] UI
		[ ] Prompts only
		[ ] Add input form - Freely enter values
		[ ] Input - Sliders or ranges
		[ ] Toggle to randomize vowels to numbers
		[ ] MAYBE - an option to save/lock or randomize one of the halves of the passphrase
		[ ] Output multiple options (let user choose #?)
		[ ] Copy to clipboard
		[ ] Add beautiful svg and delightful microanimations, emojis, sound, etc
			[ ] Sprite sheet time!
