			<p class="text-xl">The Garden is a living showcase of responsive design and interactive web elements. Like a carefully tended garden, each element grows and adapts.</p>

				<li>
					<h3 class="text-lg text">Flowing layouts shift like vines</h3>
					<p>Each component adapts naturally to its environment, responding to screen sizes and device constraints with fluid grace. Like plants reaching for light, content finds its optimal position in any space.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 class="text-lg">Shapes and colors bloom through dynamic manipulation</h3>
					<p>Watch as the garden transforms through your choices. Paint with purposeful palettes, watching as new color harmonies ripple through the landscape. Adjust the scale of growth - from intimate minor thirds to expansive perfect fifths. Prune each element by sofening or sharpening the corners. Keep it safe and protected with borders, or let the wildlife roam free.
</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 class="text-lg">Patterns emerge with accessibility and purpose in mind</h3>
					<p>Each element serves both form and function, like the precise arrangement of petals in a flower. Interactive elements respond naturally to user input, as leaves respond to touch. Navigation paths are clear and intuitive, ensuring the garden is welcoming to everyone.</p>
